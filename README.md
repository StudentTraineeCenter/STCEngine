# STCEngine
This is a 2D game engine made as a graduate thesis to the STC program. It allows the user to create a simple 2D game and easily modify the level using JSON. It is mostly made for RPGs, but other genres are possible as well.
The "STCEngine Demos" directory contains two demos to demonstrate the basic functionality, as well as a Czech user manual on controls and level editing.

Simple level editing is possible by changing the JOSN files in the "Assets" folder in the same folder as is the .exe file of the demo you wish to edit.
Game logic modification is possible by editing the "Test Apka STC Engine/Game.cs" script and building the application.

This branch contains the source code for the RPG demo, if you wish to see the platformers source code, switch to the "Platformer" branch.

Thank you for checking this out! :)
